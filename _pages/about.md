> Machine/Computer Vision is such an <b>Exciting</b>/ <b>Fast-evolving</b>/ <b>Application-practical</b> field and I am delightful to be a part of it ! As a PhD. student under supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~wildes/">Richard P. Wildes</a> York University Toronto Canada, my research focuses on video predictive understanding, which includes interesting tasks as Action/Activity Prediction/Anticiption, Video Prediction, Motion Planning, Vehicle/Pedestrian Trajectory tracking and etc. In a word, I do research on exploring the possible future.

> Before my Ph.D. journey, I worked with Professor <a href='https://www.bme.ufl.edu/labs/yang/'> Lin Yang</a> at Unversity of Florida as a master research assitant. During my stay, we came out some really cool projects towards biomedial imaging understanding (as listed below).
